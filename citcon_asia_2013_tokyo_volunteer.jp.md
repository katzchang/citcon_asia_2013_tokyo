CITCONにふさわしい会場を探して、開催を調整するボランティア。組織的活動能力が求められます。ホテルやカンファレンスセンターに関する知識があれば歓迎します。活動はカンファレンス開催予定の1年前から、開催完了まで続きます。おおむね40時間程度のコミットメントが求められます。カンファレンス開催中は特に役割はないので、普通に参加できます。
Local Coordinator - Status: Open 地域コーディネーター：募集中！

They must be available via email and phone for months leading up to the conference. Their overall time committment is usually minimal. They are not required to be available during the conference, and therefore could register to attend the conference if they like.
CITCONは毎年、様々な場所で開催されます。
Marketing Coordinator - Status: Open


For an open space conference, diversity can help to improve the overall experience. This person is responsible for getting the word out about CITCON. Not just to the same old mailing lists, but other places. This person should exhaust all possibilities, with a minimal budget (zero $) to attract people from all over the software industry. Most of their time will be spent posting to mailing lists, newsgroups, etc, but could include contacting trade magazines, local newspapers, etc. They are not required to be available during the conference, and therefore could register to attend the conference if they like.

Social Director - Status: Open


As much as CITCON is about learning and sharing knowledge, it's also about socializing with like-minded people. The social director ensures that everyone knows what is going on and where to go. During the conference, this includes "directing traffic" so that everyone makes it to the social hour, breakfast and lunch. This includes coordinating with the venue staff to ensure that the food and beverages are being served as planned. This also includes being able to help people plan post-conference activities at local pubs and restaurants. They must not be planning to attend the conference sessions as they must be available throughout the conference. This person must be available staring at 5 PM until 10 PM on Friday and starting at 8 AM until 6 PM on Saturday. This person must also be available for one hour on Thursday to do the "walk-through" with the venue.
Assistant Social Director - Status: Open


Directing the type of people that attend CITCON has been likened to "herding cats". The Social Director needs an assistant. This person assists the Social Director in ensuring a successful conference, especially by helping to notify each session room when the session is about to end. They must not be planning to attend the conference sessions as they must be available throughout the conference. This person must be available staring at 5 PM until 10 PM on Friday and starting at 8 AM until 6 PM on Saturday.
Registration Desk Attendant #1 - Status: Open


As people come to the conference, they approach the registration desk to sign in for the conference. This person is one of three that checks their name off the list and distributes the conference gift bags, which they must help to prepare. This person also helps to answer questions during the conference. Questions range from the mundane, like "Where is the washroom?" to the complex, like "Where is conference room B?". They must have a friendly disposition and be willing to help people in need. They must not be planning to attend the conference sessions as they must be available throughout the conference. They must be available starting at 4 PM until 10 PM on Friday, and starting at 8 AM until 6 PM on Saturday.
Registration Desk Attendant #2 - Status: Open


Same as Registration Desk Attendant #1.
Registration Desk Attendant #3 - Status: Open
